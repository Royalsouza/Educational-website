                <p class="text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                    knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                    include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
                    takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves.
                    Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative
                    effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of
                    teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality
                and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern
                or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been
                recognized by some governments and the United Nations. Global initiatives aim at achieving the
                Sustainable Development Goal, which promotes quality education for all. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Informal Learning</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or
                expert, to guide the learner. If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being
                taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being
                learned.For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as
                there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible
                structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small"> Educational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings together researchers in cognitive
                neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational psychology, educational technology,
                education theory and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes
                and education. Researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms
                of reading, numerical cognition,attention, and their attendant difficulties including
                dyslexia,dyscalculia and ADHD as they relate to education. Several academic institutions
                around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience
                research.</p>
